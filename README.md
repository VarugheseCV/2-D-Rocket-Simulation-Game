## 2-D Rocket Simulation Game

The 2-D Rocket Simulation Game is an exciting project developed in C++ that puts you in control of a rocket, challenging you to shoot down enemy spacecraft and avoid harmful projectiles. The game features multiple difficulty levels that ramp up the intensity and introduce new enemy behaviors.

Game Features

Objective: Your mission is to destroy combatant spacecraft and dodge incoming projectiles to survive as long as possible.

Four Difficulty Levels: The game offers four distinct difficulty levels, each with its own set of challenges and enemy behaviors.

        Level 1: Enemies move linearly, making it relatively easier to anticipate their movement patterns and take them down.

        Level 2: Enemies attempt to pursue your rocket, increasing the challenge as they actively chase you down.

        Level 3: Enemies start firing projectiles that move linearly, adding a new layer of danger that you must avoid.

        Level 4: Enemies fire projectiles that track your rocket, requiring precise maneuvering and quick reflexes to survive.

SFML Graphics Library: The project is built using the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) graphics library in C++, providing essential functionalities for graphics rendering, user input handling, and sound effects.

Installation

To enjoy the 2-D Rocket Simulation Game, follow these steps:
